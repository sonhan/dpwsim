<p>Implementation of listeners to be notified of changes of Service/Device references through the use of callback methods.</p>
<p>
The interfaces <code>DeviceListener</code> and <code>ServiceListener</code> implement a number of methods
designated as callback methods to receive notifications for a given set of events
emanating from a device or service (implementing classes are respectively 
<code>DefaultService</code> and <code>DefaultDevice</code>):
<ul>
<li>For the <code>Service</code>, if it was changed, created or deleted</li>
<li>For the <code>Device</code>, if it was changed, created, deleted and whether it is currently running</li>
</ul>

The interface <code>Reference</code> defines a protocol to obtain specific information about the service (hosting or hosted).  The implementing classes
<code>DeviceReference</code> and <code>ServiceReference</code> provide a specific interface for a device and for a service: with regards to the service, obtaining more information,
and with regards to a device, methods to add or remove a listener (see <code>DefaultClient</code> for a listener class). Adding
a listener will enable the client (listener) to receive information about device changes.
</p>
<p></p>The implementing classes of <code>ServiceReference</code> and <code>DeviceReference</code> (see org.ws4d.java.dispatch <code>ServiceReferenceHandler</code>, <code>DeviceReferenceHandler</code>)
make use of these callback methods informing listeners of a device or service change, and providing a Callback handler.
