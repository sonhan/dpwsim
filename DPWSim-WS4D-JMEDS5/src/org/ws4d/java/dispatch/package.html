<p>Implements various tools for the handling of messages between local/remote devices and clients.</p>

<p>This package contains three classes <code>MessageInformer</code>,<code>MessageListener</code> and an interface<code>MessageSelector</code>.
The default implementation of the message selector <code>DefaultMessageSelector</code> is as follows: 
the message selector looks for messages of a certain type or messages matching a number of properties, each with a list of values attached. 
For the message to be selected, it must be an exact match. That is, a message will be selected if and only if
it has matching values for all the given properties. All messages containing at
least one value for this property will be considered. The <code>AllMessageSelector</code> implementation on the other hand
 declares every incoming message  to be a match. Whilst the <code>DefaultMessageSelector</code> acts as a filter, <code>AllMessageSelector</code>
simply selects all messages.
</p>

<p><code>MessageSelectors</code> are used to create new <code>MessageListeners</code>. That is, they enable a listener to register their interest in a specific
type, or group of messages. A <code>MessageListener</code> instance is called each time an incoming message is received. These must be registered within a
<code>MessageInformer</code> instance. This enables clients to receive notifications notified about every, or a selected type of messages sent through the framework.</p>

<p>The package further contains classes defining <code>DeviceReferenceHandlers</code> upon registration of a new device (local or remote), creating a proxy in case of
a remove device, and <code>ServiceReferenceHandlers</code>, holding the service references of both local and proxy services. Both provide initialisation, updates, removal
and probing methods.</p>

<p> <code>DeviceServiceRegistry</code> implements a Registry class through which service and device listeners can be registered, with which Device/Service references can be obtained
from either their endpoint reference or their <code>HelloData</code> (data associated with a received Hello message). An HelloData instance will contain the following information
<ul>
<li>Endpoint reference</li>
<li>Metadata version</li>
<li>Scopes of the device</li>
<li>Device port types</li>
<li>Transport address of the device</li>
</ul>
